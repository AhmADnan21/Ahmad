# üöÄ Quick Deployment Guide - Ahmad Abdullah Portfolio

## Step-by-Step Deployment to Netlify

### Step 1: Prepare Your GitHub Repository

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**
   - Go to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
   - Repository name: `ahmad-portfolio`
   - Make it Public
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Push your code to GitHub**

Open terminal in your project folder and run:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Ahmad Abdullah Portfolio Website"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ahmad-portfolio.git
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify

1. **Go to Netlify**
   - Visit [https://app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)
   - Sign up or log in (you can use your GitHub account)

2. **Import your project**
   - Click "Add new site" ‚Üí "Import an existing project"
   - Click "Deploy with GitHub"
   - Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub account
   - Select your `ahmad-portfolio` repository

3. **Configure build settings**
   
   Netlify should auto-detect the settings, but verify:
   - **Build command:** `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory:** `dist`
   - Click "Deploy site"

4. **Wait for deployment**
   - Netlify will install dependencies and build your site
   - This usually takes 1-3 minutes
   - You'll see a random URL like `https://random-name-123456.netlify.app`

### Step 3: Set Custom Subdomain

1. **Change site name**
   - Go to "Site settings" (in the site dashboard)
   - Click "Change site name" under "Site information"
   - Enter: `ahmadabdullah`
   - Click "Save"

2. **Your site is now live at:**
   ```
   https://ahmadabdullah.netlify.app
   ```

### Step 4: Verify Everything Works

Visit your site and check:
- [ ] All sections load properly
- [ ] Navigation works smoothly
- [ ] Contact links work (email, phone, LinkedIn)
- [ ] Responsive design on mobile
- [ ] No broken images or styles

## üìù Future Updates

To update your portfolio:

1. Make changes to your code locally
2. Test with `npm run dev`
3. Commit and push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update: description of changes"
   git push
   ```
4. Netlify will automatically rebuild and deploy!

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Build fails on Netlify

**Error: "npm: command not found"**
- Solution: Add a `.nvmrc` file with content: `16`

**Error: "Build exceeded time limit"**
- Solution: Check for infinite loops in your code

### Site shows 404 errors

**Problem: Page refreshes show 404**
- Solution: Already handled by `netlify.toml` redirect rules

### CSS not loading

**Problem: Site looks broken**
- Solution: Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Check browser console for errors

### Contact links not working

**Problem: Email/phone links don't open**
- Solution: Check that your email client is configured
- On mobile, links should work automatically
